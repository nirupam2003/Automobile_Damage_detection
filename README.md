cardamage.py is a comination of two models
1. model1- for detecting type of damage
2. model2- which can be acquired by running yolo_car_damage.ipynb is for deteting all parts of car
3. we combine all both models to detect damage type and part of car simultaneously so we use IOU to match what damage which part of car.
